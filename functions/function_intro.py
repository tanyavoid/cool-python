"""
Functions are reusable pieces of code created to do a specific task.

They are defined (created) using def keyword and giving them a name.
The name should be descriptive and short, staring with a verb, if possible.
Then a function can be called (used) any number of times to do a task.

Sometimes functions are compared to black boxes â€” they do some stuff, but it's
not necessary to know how it's done.
